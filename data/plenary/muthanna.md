title: "Towards 6G- Enabled Ultra Reliable Low Latency V2X Communications"
---
6G networks are evolving with new features and order-of-magnitude improvements in performance metrics, especially in Tbps-scale data rate, µs-scale latency, and Kbps/Hz-scale spectral efﬁciency.
Consequently, a massive amount of devices and a high variation of applications are dramatically increasing in diverse, such as virtual/augmented reality, autonomous driving, digital twin, and Holographic communication, and beyond in different network scenarios, including smart factory, smart agriculture, and smart City.
Many 6G applications are Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) that require low end to end latency. 
This talk will be about URRLC applications , specifications and main requirements of URLLC applications, also will be discussed a novel network structures and technologies to enable such systems.
